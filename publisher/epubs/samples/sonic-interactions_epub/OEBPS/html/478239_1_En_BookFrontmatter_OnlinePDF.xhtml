					<p class="Para" id="Par1">Sonic Interaction Design (SID) is the study and exploitation of sound
						being one of the principal channels conveying information, meaning, esthetic, and emotional
						qualities in interactive contexts. The field of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Sonic
							Interactions in Virtual Environments</em> (SIVE) extends SID to immersive media, i.e.,
						virtual/augmented/mixed reality (XR). Considering a virtuality continuum, this book mainly
						focused on virtual reality (VR) also facing occasionally mixed and hybrid reality settings.</p>
					<p class="Para" id="Par2">The basic and most obvious assumption that motivates this volume is: it is
						hard to live in a world without sound and it is hard in virtual environments (VE) too. VR
						without plausible and convincing sounds feels unnatural to users. Auditory information is a
						powerful omnidirectional source of learning for our interaction in real and virtual
						environments. The good news brought by this book is that VR finally sounds plausible. Advances
						in several fields are now able to provide an immersive listening experience that is perceptually
						indistinguishable from reality which means that immersive sounds could make interaction
						intrinsically natural. Auralization and spatial audio technologies play a fundamental role in
						providing immersion and presence in VR applications at an unprecedented level. The combination
						of recent developments in VR headsets and earables further strengthens the perceptual validity
						of multimodal virtual environments and experiences.</p>
					<p class="Para" id="Par3">We can therefore promote a true audio-centered and audio-first design for
						VR with levels of realism and immersiveness that can even surpass the visual counterpart.
						Visuals, although rightly emphasized by many studies and products, are often not very
						effectively enhanced and strengthened by sound. The final result is a weakening of multisensory
						integration and the corresponding VR potentials that strongly determine the quality and
						durability of the experience.</p>
					<p class="Para" id="Par4">The editors would like to identify two starting points in the past 10
						years that have given rise and awareness to the SIVE research area and studies. The first
						episode is symbolic: we would like to anecdotally bring back from our memories the first meeting
						between us, the two editors of the book. The year was 2011, exactly 10 years ago. Michele had
						recently started his Ph.D. at the Sound and Music Computing Group of the Department of
						Information Engineering at the University of Padua, under the supervision of Dr. Avanzini. The
						Italian Association of Musical Informatics (AIMI) organized the workshop “Sound and Music
						Computing for Human-Computer Interaction” at the ninth edition of the Biannual Conference of the
						Italian ACM SIGCHI Chapter (CHItaly) at the beautiful Alghero in Sardinia in early September. A
						great period for the seaside.</p>
					<p class="Para" id="Par5">Michele was asked to write his first conference paper to be presented at
						the workshop entitled “Customized 3D Sound for Innovative Interaction Design,” An article with a
						high-sounding title that promises a lot but provides little: in short, an article of which not
						to be proud. On the other hand, there were some valuable references to the <em
							class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">egocentric audio perspective </em>that will be formalized in the
						introductory chapter of this book. However, the reason why we tell this anecdote is that at his
						first presentation at a scientific conference for the Ph.D. student Michele Geronazzo, among the
						very small audience, there was Dr. Stefania Serafin. Ten years ago, we began to discuss issues
						that connected sonic interaction design with immersive 3D audio in VR. The AIMI president of
						that time failed to get the workshop’s contributions included in the official ACM CHItaly
						proceedings despite a regular peer-review process. The poor Ph.D. student Michele found himself
						without an official publication, at his first conference, in an unknown scientific community. We
						like to think that at that event and with that meeting started something much more relevant and
						impactful: SIVE. We are here to give it a shape in this book edited and structured together.</p>
					<p class="Para" id="Par6">Another temporal coincidence brings us to connect this story with the
						second and official starting point of this adventure. Michele’s unpublished conference paper was
						finally published within his doctoral thesis, defended in 2014, the year in which the <em
							class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">IEEE Virtual Reality</em> workshop series “<em
							class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Sonic Interactions in Virtual Environments (SIVE)</em>” started
						(<span class="ExternalRef"><a href="https://sive.create.aau.dk/"><span
									class="RefSource">https://​sive.​create.​aau.​dk/​</span></a></span>). The mission
						of IEEE VR SIVE was to increase among the virtual reality community and junior researchers the
						awareness of the importance of sonic elements when designing immersive XR environments. However,
						we can also identify a certain degree of reciprocity while considering the fragmented nature and
						specificity of those studies aim at developing immersive XR environments for sound and music.
						First, we, therefore, refer to our beloved Sound and Music Computing (SMC) network, and then we
						consider the International Community for Auditory Display (ICAD), the Audio Engineering Society
						(AES), and the communities linked to the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical
						Expression (NIME), the Digital Audio Effects (DAFX), and the Sonic Interaction Design COST
						Action (COST-SID IC601, ended in 2012). All these communities address aspects of the SIVE topics
						according to their specificities. No institutional nor contextual references that collect
						technological developments, best practices, and creative efforts related to the peculiarities of
						immersive VEs existed before the SIVE workshop. The book follows a similar philosophy trying to
						give an exhaustive view of those multidisciplinary topics already mentioned in our two recent
						reviews.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn1" id="Fn1_source" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
						It features state-of-the-art research on real-time auralization, sonic interaction design in VR,
						quality of the experience in multimodal environments, and applications. We aim to provide an
						organized starting point on which to develop a new generation of immersive experiences and
						applications. Since the editors are aware of the very fast social transformation by the
						acceleration in the development of digital technologies, all chapters should be read as entry
						points. Future scenarios and solutions will necessarily evolve by combining emerging research
						areas such as artificial intelligence, ubiquitous and pervasive computing, quantum technologies,
						as well as continuous discoveries in the neuroscientific field and anthropological reflections
						on the authenticity of the experience in VR.</p>
					<p class="Para" id="Par9">For this reason, contributing authors and editors include
						interdisciplinary experts from the fields of computer science, engineering, acoustics,
						psychology, design, humanities, and beyond. So that we can give to the reader a broad view and a
						clear introduction to the state-of-the-art technologies and design principles, and to the
						challenges that might be awaiting us in the future.</p>
					<p class="Para" id="Par10">Through an overview of emerging topics, theories, methods, tools, and
						practices in sonic interactions in virtual environments research, the book aims to establish the
						basis for further development of this new research area. The authors were invited to contribute
						to specific topics according to their well-known expertise. They followed a predefined structure
						outlined by the editors.</p>
					<p class="Para" id="Par010">The book is divided into four parts:</p>
					<p class="Para" id="Par11"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Part I, Introduction:</strong> this
						theoretical part frames the background and the key themes in SIVE. The editors address several
						phenomenological foundational issues intending to shape a new research field from an archipelago
						of studies scattered in different research communities.</p>
					<p class="Para" id="Par12"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Part II, Interactive and Immersive
							Audio:</strong> we cover the system requirement part with four chapters introducing and
						analyzing audio-related technological aspects and challenges. With some overlaps and
						connections, the four chapters deal with the plausibility of an immersive rendering able to
						tackle the computational burden. To do so, we deal with methods and algorithms for real-time
						rendering considering sound production, propagation, and spatialization, respectively. Finally,
						the reproduction and evaluation phase allows closing the development loop of new audio
						technologies.</p>
					<p class="Para" id="Par13"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Part III,</strong> <strong
							class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Sonic Interactions:</strong> a sonic interaction design part
						devoted to emphasizing the peculiar aspects of sound in immersive media. In particular, spatial
						interactions are important where we would like to produce and transform ideas and actions to
						create meaning with VR, as well as the virtual auditory space is an information container that
						could be shaped by users. As the VR systems enter people’s lives, manufacturers, developers, and
						creators should carefully consider an embodied experience ready to share a common space with
						peers, collaboratively.</p>
					<p class="Para" id="Par14"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Part IV, Sonic Experiences:</strong>
						the last part focuses on multimodal integration for sonic experiences in VR with the help of
						several case studies. Starting from a literature review of multimodal experiments and
						experiences with sound, this last part offers some reflections on the concept of audio-visual
						immersion and audio-haptic integration able to form our ecology of everyday or musical sounds.
						Finally, the potentials of VR to transport artists and spectators into a world of imagination
						and unprecedented expression is taken as an exemplar of what multimodal and immersive
						experiences can elicit in terms of emotional and rational engagement.</p>
					<p class="Para" id="Par15">In the following, a summary for each chapter is provided to help the
						reader to follow the proposed narrative structure.</p>
					<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec1">

							illustrates the editors’ vision of the SIVE research field. The main concept introduced here
							is the egocentric audio perspective in a technologically mediated environment. The listeners
							should be entangled with their auditory digital twins in a participatory and enacted
							exploration for sense-making characterized by a personalized and multisensory first-person
							spatial reference frame. Intra-actions between humans and non-human agents/actors
							dynamically and fluidly determine immersion and coherence of the experience,
							participatively. SID aims to facilitate the diffraction of knowledge in different tasks and
							contexts.</p>

						<h2 class="Heading">Part II</h2>
						<p class="Para" id="Par17">Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a
									href="478239_1_En_2_Chapter.xhtml"><span class="RefSource">2</span></a></span>
							addresses the first building block of SIVE, i.e., the modeling and synthesis of sound
							sources, focusing on procedural approaches. Special emphasis is placed on physics-based
							sound synthesis methods and their potential for improved interactivity concerning the sense
							of presence and embodiment of a user in a virtual environment.</p>
						<p class="Para" id="Par18">In Chap. <span class="ExternalRef"><a
									href="478239_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml"><span class="RefSource">3</span></a></span>,
							critical challenges in auralization systems in virtual reality and games are identified,
							including progressing from modeling enclosures to complex, general scenes such as a city
							block with both indoor and outdoor areas. The authors provide a general overview of
							real-time auralization systems, their historical design and motivations, and how novel
							systems have been designed to tackle the new challenges.</p>
						<p class="Para" id="Par19">Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a
									href="478239_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml"><span class="RefSource">4</span></a></span> deals
							with the concepts of adaptation in a binaural audio context, considering first the
							adaptation of the rendering system to the acoustic and perceptual properties of the user,
							and second the adaptation of the user to the rendering quality of the system. The authors
							introduce the topics of head-related transfer function (HRTF) selection (system-to-user
							adaptation) and HRTF accommodation (user-to-system adaptation).</p>
						<p class="Para" id="Par20">Finally, Chap. <span class="ExternalRef"><a
									href="478239_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml"><span class="RefSource">5</span></a></span>
							concludes the second part of the book by introducing audio reproduction techniques for

						<h2 class="Heading">Part III</h2>
						<p class="Para" id="Par21">Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a
									href="478239_1_En_6_Chapter.xhtml"><span class="RefSource">6</span></a></span> opens
							the third part of the book devoted to SID within virtual environments. In particular, it
							deals with space, a fundamental feature of VR systems, and more generally, human experience.
							In this chapter, the authors propose a typology of VR interactive audio systems, focusing on
							the function of systems and the role of space in their design. Spatial categories are
							proposed to be able to analyze the role of space within existing interactive audio VR
							products.</p>
						<p class="Para" id="Par22">Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a
									href="478239_1_En_7_Chapter.xhtml"><span class="RefSource">7</span></a></span>
							promotes the following great opportunities offered by VR systems: to bring experiences,
							technologies, and users’ physical and experiential bodies (soma) together, and to study and
							teach these open-ended relationships of enaction and meaning-making in the framework of soma
							design. In this chapter, the authors introduce soma design and focus on design exemplars
							that come from physical rehabilitation applied to sonic interaction strategies.</p>
						<p class="Para" id="Par23">Then, Chap. <span class="ExternalRef"><a
									href="478239_1_En_8_Chapter.xhtml"><span class="RefSource">8</span></a></span>
							investigates how to design the user experience without being detrimental to the creative
							output, and how to design spatial configurations to support both individual creativity and
							collaboration. The authors examine user experience design for collaborative music-making in
							shared virtual environments, giving design implications for the auditory information and the
							collaborative facilitation.</p>
						<p class="Para" id="Par24">Finally, Chap. <span class="ExternalRef"><a

							multimodal simulations. Authors present some design aspects for mixing in VR, investigating
							existing virtual music mixing products, and creating a framework for a virtual spatial-music

							helps the reader to understand how sound enhances, substitutes, or modifies the way we
							perceive and interact with the world. This is an important element when designing
							interactive multimodal experiences. In this chapter, Stefania presents an overview of sound
							in a multimodal context, ranging from basic experiments in multimodal perception to more
							advanced interactive experiences.</p>
						<p class="Para" id="Par26">Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a

							focuses on audiovisual experiences, by discussing the idea of immersion, and by providing an
							experimental paradigm that can be used for assessing immersion. The authors highlight the
							factors that can influence immersion and they differentiate immersion from the quality of
							experience (QoE). The theoretical implications for conducting experiments on these aspects
							are presented, and the authors provide a case study for subjective evaluation after
							assessing the merits and demerits of subjective and objective measures.</p>
						<p class="Para" id="Par27">Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a
									href="478239_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml"><span class="RefSource">12</span></a></span>
							focuses on audio-haptic experiences, being concerned with haptic augmentations having
							effects on auditory perception, for example, about how different vibrotactile cues may
							affect the perceived sound quality. The authors review the results of different experiments
							showing that the auditory and somatosensory channels together can produce constructive
							effects resulting in a measurable perceptual enhancement.</p>
						<p class="Para" id="Par28">Finally, Chap. <span class="ExternalRef"><a

							examines the special case of virtual music experiences, with particular emphasis on the
							performance with Immersive Virtual Musical Instruments (IVMI) and the relation between
							musicians and spectators. The authors assess in detail the several technical and conceptual
							challenges linked to the composition of IVMI performances on stage (i.e., their

						my knowledge extraction process. I went through the three “HCI waves” with my own time:
						ergonomics and engineering in Padova, psychology, and cognition in Verona, embodied design and
						UX in Copenhagen. I found recognition and maturity in London, and, finally, Udine gave me the
						time to find my identity. I would like to thank all my mentors and peers who made me grow in the
						research jungle, on numerous occasions and at different moments in my life. A big thanks go to
						my beloved family who supports me and always brings me back down to earth.</p>
